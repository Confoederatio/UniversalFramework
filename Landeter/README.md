# Eoscala/Velkscala (Production)

> [!WARNING]
> `economic_datasets/`, `geographic_datasets/`, `node_modules/`, and `output/` are excluded. The other folders apart from `node_modules/` represent ~130GB of input data, and as such, cannot be included within Eoscala/Velkscala's production code efficiently. We will eventually work on a fix.

A production repository for Eoscala/Velkscala. You can view the released version of the repository [here](https://github.com/Confoederatio/Eoscala-Velkscala).
